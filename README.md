# MailMergeLib 5.0
MailMergeLib is a SMTP mail client library which provides comfortable mail merge capabilities e.g. by placeholders for plain and HTML text, including inline images and attachments. MailMergLib has good sending throughput by sending mail messages in parallel and it is nicely fault-tolerant for unattended production systems.

MailMergeLib uses [MimeKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit) and [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit). Both are outstandling open source libraries under active development, which are by far better than Microsoft's System.Net.Mail.

MailMergeLib was introduced back in 2007 on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19546/MailMergeLib-A-NET-Mail-Client-Library). The last version published there is 4.0. It is based on System.Net.Mail. Version 5 published on GitHub is a major rewrite, and it is not backwards compatible.

MailMergLib 5.0 available in this repository is a preview version under heavy development, and it is not recommended for production use.
